        Pozar Thermal Bath: Imagine yourself in a pool amidst steep rocks, natural waterfalls and wild vegetation. Feel the soothing warmth of the water (37°C) taking the strain off your body, and let your eyes wander around the verdant gorge where Agios Nikolaos (Saint Nicholas) stream flows, (aka Thermopotamos meaning 'hot river' in Greek). Heighten your senses in this pristine nature where green is King and even the branches of the trees (mainly planes and willows) are all covered in luxuriant ivy. Relish the stimulating sensation of the 37°C crystal clear waters in the outdoor pool that is surrounded by the wild! In the historic district of Pella, the capital of the Ancient Greek Kingdom of Macedonia, the beauty of Greek nature will add to your desire for wellness.

        The Silversmithing Museum: The Silversmithing Museum is located in the Castle of Ioannina, and more specifically in the western bastion of the north-eastern acropolis (Its Kale). It occupies the bastion’s two levels, as well as the adjacent building of the old cookhouses. Its objective is to preserve our knowledge of Epirote silversmithing and to disseminate information about its technology to the wider public. Also, to tie in this technology to the social context of the period during which it was developed and flourished.

        Mount Olympus: Mt. Olympus’ wonderful nature of rich flora (over 1700 species, more than 20 of which endemic) and fauna (more than 30 species of mammals, 100 species of birds, 18 species of reptiles) left the modern Greeks with no choice but to proclaim it the first National Forest in 1938. The Pinus leucodermis in this area forms the highest forest levels in Europe (2,500 m). The greatest concentration of rare plants and animals establishes the area as a true paradise for the conservation of rare flora and fauna of Greece and Europe. The area makes up the core of the National Park which was founded in 1938.
