        The country includes 6,000 islands and islets scattered in the Greek
        Seas, of which only 227 islands are inhabited. The Greek coastline
        offers a diverse landscape: beaches stretching over many kilometres,
        sheltered bays and coves, sandy beaches, sand-dunes, pebble beaches,
        wetlands and deltas, caves formed by seawater and dark-coloured sand
        in volcanic areas.
